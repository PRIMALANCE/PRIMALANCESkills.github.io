            <h2>SKILLS</h2>
<p align="justify">
    For someone who is afraid of trying different things, I still have a few skills in various areas. 
    Among them, I believe I am good at singing, but I am too shy to show it.</b> 
    Singing is something I inherit from my parents, who are great singers. There are times when I want to express myself through music, but my fear holds me back.    
    I sometimes sing when I'm alone. I wish I had the courage to show it. Maybe one day, I'll overcome my shyness. 
    I also enjoy working with digital tools for creativity, such as designing user interfaces and exploring elements of digital art.  
    Aside from singing, I also have a keen interest in technology, particularly in web design. 
    I enjoy creating visually appealing and functional websites using HTML and CSS. 
    I am continuously learning and improving my skills in this field, hoping to develop more complex and interactive designs in the future.
    My passion for technology extends to web design, where I enjoy creating aesthetically pleasing and functional websites.
    I primarily use HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and I am continuously learning new techniques to enhance my designs.
    I love the challenge of making a website visually engaging while ensuring it remains user-friendly and responsive.
    As I progress, I want to incorporate more advanced technologies, such as JavaScript and modern frameworks like React, to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
    My goal is to create websites that not only look great but also provide seamless user experiences. 
    I am also skilled in playing fighting video games, particularly Tekken and Brawlhalla. 
    These games require fast reflexes, deep understanding of character mechanics, and strategic thinking. 
    I enjoy mastering different characters, learning combos, and analyzing matchups to outplay my opponents. 
    Competing against skilled players enhances my reaction time and decision-making abilities. 
    The thrill of executing a perfect combo or a clutch comeback fuels my passion for the genre.
    Gaming has taught me patience, adaptability, and the importance of practice, which I apply to other aspects of my life.

        <section class="Hobbies">
            <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
<p align="justify">
    I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball just for fun. While I’m not a professional athlete, I find these sports a great way to stay active, relieve stress, and bond with friends. 
    Playing basketball helps improve my reflexes and coordination, while volleyball enhances my teamwork and communication skills. I enjoy the friendly competition and the thrill of the game, even if I’m just playing casually.
    Aside from sports, I love watching TV shows and movies.
    I have a wide range of interests, from action to dramas and even anime.
    Each genre offers something unique, whether it’s the intense storytelling, cinematic brilliance, or emotional depth of the characters. K-dramas like <b>Itaewon Class, Hospital Playlist, and Study Group</b> keep me engaged with their meaningful life lessons and compelling narratives.
    On the other hand, anime such as <b>Solo Leveling, Haikyuu, and One Piece</b> fuel my excitement with epic battles, character growth, and inspiring journeys.
    I also enjoy diving into manga and manhwa, including <b>Blue Lock, Hanlim Gym, Vinland Saga, One Punch Man, Dandadan, and Dr. Stone,</b> which provide immersive storytelling and stunning artwork.

        <section class="Interest">
            <h2>INTEREST</h2>
<p align="justify">
    I have a wide range of interests that reflect my curiosity and desire to learn new things. 
    One of my biggest interests is technology, especially in the fields of web design and UI/UX design. 
    I enjoy exploring how websites and applications are structured, how user experiences are shaped, and how aesthetics play a role in functionality. 
    I love experimenting with HTML, CSS, and other design tools, and I aim to develop my skills further to create professional-level designs.
    Beyond web design, I have a growing interest in digital art and visual design. While I am still in the early stages of learning, I enjoy experimenting with design tools and exploring different art styles. Whether it’s designing website layouts, creating concept art, or playing around with typography and color schemes, I find joy in expressing creativity through visuals. I hope to improve my skills and eventually create original artwork or collaborate on design projects.
    My love for gaming goes beyond casual play—I am fascinated by the competitive aspect of gaming, particularly in fighting games and strategic gameplay. Games like Tekken and Brawlhalla challenge me to think quickly, master mechanics, and adapt to different opponents. I enjoy watching esports tournaments, analyzing pro players’ strategies, and applying those techniques to my own gameplay.
    Gaming, for me, is not just about entertainment; it’s a test of skill, patience, and adaptability. The competitive nature of fighting games pushes me to develop discipline and perseverance. Losing a match may be frustrating, but it teaches me to learn from my mistakes, analyze my weaknesses, and come back stronger. The feeling of executing a perfect combo, winning a close match, or outplaying an opponent in a high-pressure situation is incredibly satisfying. It fuels my passion for the genre and motivates me to keep improving.
